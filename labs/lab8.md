Welcome to week 8!

## PyCharm recap

This week we continue using PyCharm and running code in the terminal. In [lab 7](https://joshhug.github.io/LeidenITP/labs/lab7/) you can find information about: installing anaconda, opening projects, configuring unittests, reading unittests results, and debugging.

## Overview of This Lab

In addition to the warmup exercise earlier, this week we have ... different exercises that range in difficulty:
 * Exercise 1: 
 * Exercise 2: (standard)
 * Exercise 3: (standard)
 * Exercise 4: (standard)
 * Exercise 5: (standard)
 * Exercise 6: 
 * Exercise 7:  (challenge, hard)
 * Exercise 8:  (challenge, very hard)

All students, regardless of experience, should be able to complete the four standard exercises. Whether you complete all four is up to you.

The three exercises marked as "challenge" provide additional practice for interested students. We believe that any student in this class who completes the standard exercises should be able to complete the "medium" difficulty challenge, which extends exercise 2 by making a pretty print.

For more advanced students, you might find the more difficult `Blurring an Images` and `Make an Image Criminal Friendly` exercises to be more interesting. Feel free to skip the standard exercises if you think they are insufficiently challenging.

If you feel that this week's challenges are too hard for you, feel free to do a challenging exercise from last week which should be easier now that you know more.
