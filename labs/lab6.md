Welcome to week 6!

## PyCharm

Starting this week, we're saying goodbye to CodingBat. From now on, we'll be using PyCharm to write and test all of our code.

Start by downloading the .zip file for this week's code. Unzip the file.

Now open PyCharm and select ...

(add screenshots and further directions)

### Running a Test

Try opening `lab6_intro.py`. Click the "run" button in PyCharm and you should see two red x's appear. This is because the code we currently have provided in `lab6_intro.py` is not correct.

Modify the `squared_plus_one` function so that it is correct and try running the tests again. This time you should get a green arrow.

Lastly, modify the `remove_last_item` function so that it is correct, and try running the tests again. This time all tests have passed. You're ready to move on to this week's exercises.

This week we have 5 different exercises that range in difficulty. For those of you who are newer to programming, you might stick to only the first three (Conversion2D_1D, Enumerate, and Scrabble). For those of you with more experience, you might consider only completing some of the later exercises.

## Conversion2D_1D

To get more practice with basic Python, we're going to write some code that works on lists that contains lists. For example, consider the list `x = ["cat", 5, ["dog", "cow", "kaas", "koe"]]]`. This list has 3 items. `x[0]` is the string "cat". `x[1]` is the number 5. `x[2]` is also a list, in this case of length 4.

Open "Conversion2D_1D.py" and work your way through the exercises.

## Enumerate

The `enumerate` keyword in Python allows us to (brief explanation). 

Open `enumerate.py`. 

## Scrabble (challenging)

The last set of exercises that we'd like everyone to complete is `scrabble.py`. 

## fibonacci (hard)

Fibonacci.py contains some additional exercises that [describe them]. 

## add (very hard)

This week we've included one especially challening exercise.
