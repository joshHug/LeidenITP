Welkom, to the extra exercise page. Here, extra exercise will be posted for practising. These exercise are not mandatory and can range from very easy to very hard. This can also happen within one exercise, the first function might be very easy and the last very hard. The idea is that at the end of ITP you should be able to solve all of them. Behind easy exercise you can find the range of difficulty in the file.

Note, It can happen that some of these exercise will be used in the lab. 

The exercises are divided per Topic, but also per Syntax that you can practise. 

## Opening Exercise

Start by downloading the zip file from brightspace using [this link]. Unzip the files.

Now open PyCharm and select open and select the folder you just created (when unzipping). The folder contains folders for each topic. In the topic folders you can find the python files with the exercises.

## updating your folders with new exercises

When you already downloaded an older zip file, but there are new exercises. Go to brightspace and download the zipfolder agian using [this link]. Now, unzip the files in the same folder as where you unzipped it the first time. **VERY IMPORTANT WHEN YOUR FILEMANAGER ASKS YOU WHAT TO DO WITH DUPLICATE FILES CHOOSE SKIP NEW FILES AND/OR NOT OVERWRITE OLD FILES!**

## Topic

The last function always asks you to use the standard python library function.
