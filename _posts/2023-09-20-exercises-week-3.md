There is no lab session on Friday 22 September, but we recommend you do the following exercises on CodingBat at home to practise with the lecture material.

You can refer to [lab 2](/LeidenITP/2023/09/14/lab-2.html) for a refresher on CodingBat.

Should you have any questions, please ask those in [the discussion forum on Brightspace](https://brightspace.universiteitleiden.nl/d2l/le/240322/discussions/List). We will also practice these topics during the lab session on Friday 29 September.
