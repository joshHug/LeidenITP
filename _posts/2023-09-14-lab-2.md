Welcome to week 2! We hope you like the new look of the lab.

## Intro to CodingBat

### Exercise 1: Two Times Sum

Last week, you ran your code on your own computer using PyCharm.

This week, we'll be writing our code using a website called `CodingBat`. This website will be able to tell us whether our code is correct or not. We'll come back to using PyCharm later.

Start by going to this URL: [https://codingbat.com/prob/p254678](https://codingbat.com/prob/p254678).

Optionally, you can use "create account" in the top right of the page. Doing so will allow you to track your progress. This isn't required, and these exercises are not for a grade.

When you arrive at the page, you should see something that looks like:

Your code will go on the line with the cursor. For this problem we'll just give away the answer.

**Important:** In lab 1, you always gave your results by using `print`. In CodingBat, you'll instead use `return`. Unlike `print`, you should not use parentheses when using `return`. We'll talk about the difference between `print` and `return` in a couple of weeks.

Let's try submitting our solution. Add the line `return 2*(x+y)` so that the code looks like this:

```python
def two_times_sum(x, y):
  return 2*(x+y)
```

Put in the code, click "Go", and you should see this:

### Exercise 2: Three Times Max Plus One

Now it's your turn to solve a problem on your own.

This time we'll work on this problem [https://codingbat.com/prob/p229485](https://codingbat.com/prob/p229485).

Start by giving the solution `return 3*x`, i.e. the code should look like this:

```python
def three_times_max(x, y, z):
  return 3*x
```

Then click `Go`, and you'll see:

The reason we get 1 green box, and 3 red boxes is as follows:
 * For the first example `(5, 3, 1)`, the maximum is `5`, so the expected answer is `15`. Our code returns `3*x`, which is `3*5`, which is `15`. Our answer matches the expected answer, so we get a green box for being correct.
 * For the second example `(1, 2, 4)`, the maximum is `4`, so the expected answer is `12`. Our code returns `3*x`, which is `3*1`, which is `3`. Our answer does not match the expected answer, so we get a red box for being incorrect.

Correct the code. If you're stuck, try clicking "Show Hint".

Once you've passed this exercise, you're ready to start using the new material from lecture #2. 

## Booleans Practice

In the lecture, we covered booleans and operators. For example, the expression `True and False` evaluates to `False`. In other words `True and False == False`.

The following statements cover all of the important facts we learned about the Boolean operators `not`, `and` and `or`. For a further refresher, you can refer to the lecture slides on [Brightspace](https://brightspace.universiteitleiden.nl/d2l/le/lessons/240322/topics/2628793).

```python
not True == False
not False == True
True and True == True
True and False == False
False and True == False
False and False == False
True or True == True
True or False == True
False or True == True
False or False == False
```

The following code covers everything important about `if-elif-else` blocks from lecture.

```python
if a < 10:
  print("A is smaller than 10!")
elif a == 10:
  print("A is 10!")
else:
  print("I guess it is bigger than 10?")
```

Do the following exercises on `CodingBat`. If you're someone who came into the class already knowing this material, consider doing the optional challenge below.

- [cigar_party](https://codingbat.com/prob/p195669)
- [caught_speeding](https://codingbat.com/prob/p137202)
- [sorta_sum](https://codingbat.com/prob/p116620)
- [alarm_clock](https://codingbat.com/prob/p119867)
- [near_ten](https://codingbat.com/prob/p165321)

Optional challenge for people with prior programming experience: Do these problems without using `if-elif-else`. It's possible, but you'll have to very clever and pay close attention to the week 2 lecture notes. Note: You'd never want to write code like this in real life. Writing easy-to-read code is better than writing clever-and-tricky code.

## Lists Practice

In lecture, we talked about lists. For example, the list `L = ["cat", "dog", "potato"]` has three items in it. The 0th item can be accessed with `L[0]`, and we know that `L[0] == "cat"`. The length of the list can be found using `len`, e.g. `len(L) == 3`.

One new thing we'll teach you in this lab is that indexing can use negative numbers, which means to start from the back. For example `L[-1] == "potato"`. Here `-1` means the end of the list. `L[-2]` means the item one item back from the end of the list, e.g. `L[-2] == "dog"`.

These facts are summarized concisely below with a slightly different example:
```python
a = [3, 1, 4] # creates the list [3, 1, 4]
a[0] == 3 # a[n] returns the element of a at index (position) n
# where the first element is at index 0
a[1] == 1
a[2] == 4
a[-1] == 4 # negative indices start counting from the last element
a[-2] == 1
a[-3] == 3
len(a) == 3 # len(a) returns the length of a
```
