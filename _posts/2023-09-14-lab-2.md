# Welcome

Welcome to week 2.

## Intro to CodingBat

For this week's lab, we'll be using a website called `CodingBat`. Unlike last week, where you were just running code on your own computer, you'll put your code into the `CodingBat` website and it will tell you whether you are right or wrong.

Start by going to the [https://codingbat.com/prob/p254678](https://codingbat.com/prob/p254678).

Optionally, you can use "create account" in the top right of the page. Doing so will allow you to track your progress. This isn't required, and these exercises are not for a grade.

```python
x = x + 5
```
